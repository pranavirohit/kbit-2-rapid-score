"""
This file has the main helper functions I'm using to automate KBIT-2 scoring.

- processImage(filePath):
  Takes in the path to an image file, converts it to grayscale using OpenCV,
  applies binary thresholding (to help Tesseract read it better), and returns 
  the processed image as a PIL object so it's compatible with Tesseract OCR.

- extractAllText(image):
  Takes in a PIL image and uses Tesseract to extract all text from it.
  Right now it's using page segmentation mode 6 (treats the image as a block of text).

- processPDF(pdfPath, outputFolder):
  Takes a scanned PDF (like the scoring tables from the KBIT-2 manual),
  converts each page to an image (using pdf2image), and saves each one 
  as a PNG in the specified folder. Right now I'm hardcoding the first page 
  to be page 78 since that's where Table B.1 starts in the book.

- getTableAge(image):
  Placeholder function I want to build later â€” goal is to detect the 
  age range from each scoring table page and use it to name the files in a way that's
  more meaningful.
