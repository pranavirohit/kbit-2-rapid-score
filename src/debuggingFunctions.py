KBIT-2 Visual Line Debugger

This file opens a KBIT-2 test page and overlays red rectangles on top of all
the vertical lines detected by getVerticalLinesPositions(). It's meant to be
a quick visual check to confirm if the line detection is working properly, as
I wasn't getting the expected 9 vertical lines.
