'''
Result Processing Placeholder

This file is meant to connect the user's selected output preferences 
(for example, which score categories they chose to include) with the actual 
KBIT-2 data loaded from the uploaded CSV or Excel file. 

Eventually, this function will take in the uploaded file, process the relevant 
score data, and generate a cleaned results DataFrame that reflects the user's 
selections.

Here's what each function does:

- processUploadedFile(app, filePath):
    Placeholder function for now. Will eventually read the uploaded CSV or Excel 
    file, filter it based on selected categories, and return the final results 
    table to be displayed or saved.
