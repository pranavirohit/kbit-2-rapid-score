## Brain Dump
1. Need a way to convert the PDF with all the Table 1 scans into images that can be processed
2. Basically take the scanned PDF, seperate each image, process each image through OCR
(OCR is what makes it gray scale), then use tesseract to do text extraction
3. Not entirely sure yet on how I want to store the data/what data structure I want to use
4. But data extracted should be seperated by age and month, since that's what determines the
other unique parameters of the test
