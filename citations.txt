Below the dashed line, include easily understandable and verifiable 
citations to all the major sources you used for your project, as described
in the TP document: 
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/term-project-and-hack112.html#tp-policies

In addition, your code must also include citations directly in the code that 
make it clear where you use code that is partly or entirely not of your 
original design, and what the source is for that code.

## AI Assistance
### ChatGPT by OpenAI
Prompts Used:
"How do I install OpenCV on Visual Studio Code?"
"How do I install Tesseract on Windows?"
"Why is pytesseract not being recognized in my script?"
"What does the 'M' next to my file in VS Code mean?"
"Why is my import line showing as gray?"
"What's the difference between PowerShell, CMD, and Python?"

I spent most of today debugging the Python environment in VS Code, given 
that I had this setup previously in Google Colab and it's my first time working
on a program that runs locally. ChatGPT helped me clarify features of VS Code
and the libraries I installed in VS Code, but the test code for CMU graphics 
was my own. It also helped me reconfigure my gitHub settings (from my high
school ID to my CMU ID).
